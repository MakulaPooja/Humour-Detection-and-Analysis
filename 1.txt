The first mouse pounds a shot of scotch, slams the glass onto the bar, turns to the second mouse and says, "When I see a mousetrap, I lie on my back and set it off with my foot. When the bar comes down, I catch it in my teeth, bench press it twenty times to work up an appetite, and then make off with the cheese."The second mouse orders up two shots of sour mash, pounds them both, slams each glass onto the bar, turns to the first mouse, and replies, "Yeah, well when I see rat poison, I collect as much as I can, take it home, grind it up to a powder, and add it to my coffee each morning so I can get a good buzz going for the rest of the day." The first mouse and the second mouse then turn to the third mouse.The third mouse lets out a long sigh and says to the first two, "I don't have time for this.

How fast will she go?” “About 270,” the executive responds. “Come on,” says the old man. Just then, the light turns green and the executive decides to show the old man what the car can do. He floors it, and within seconds the car is doing 270. But suddenly, he notices in his rear-view mirror a dot that seems to be getting closer and closer, and so he comes to a stop. Then, whoooooooosh, “the thing” goes flying by! “What in the heck was that?” says the executive. “What can go faster than my Fantasy?” Suddenly, “the thing” comes racing back towards him, and whoooooosh, passes right by.This time the executive got a better look, and so help him, it looked like the old man on the Vespa. “That just couldn’t be,” he says to himself. Then, through his rear-view mirror, he sees it again. All of the sudden, WHAM! It smashes into the back end of the car. The executive jumps out, and sure enough, it’s the old man on the Vespa that crashed into him. “Are you OK?” asks the executive. “Is there anything I can do for you?” “Yes,” replies the old man, “unhook my suspenders from your side-view mirror, please.”</text><score>4</score></joke>

As he pulled his eyelid down to dislodge the particle, the gorilla went crazy, bent open the bars, and beat the hapless fellow senseless. When the guy came to, the zookeeper was anxiously bending over him, and as soon as he was able to talk he explained what had happened. The zookeeper nodded sagely and explained that in gorilla language, pulling down your eyelid meant “fuck you.” The explanation didn’t make the gorilla’s victim feel any better, and he vowed revenge. The next day he bought two large knives, two party hats, two party horns, and a large sausage. Putting the sausage in his pants, he hurried to the zoo and over to the gorilla’s cage, into which he tossed a hat, a knife, and a party horn. Knowing that the big apes were natural mimics, he put on a party hat. The gorilla looked at him, looked at the hat, and put it on. Next he picked up his horn and blew on it. The gorilla picked up his horn and did the same. Then the man picked up his knife, whipped the sausage out of his pants, and sliced it neatly in two. The gorilla looked at the knife in his cage, looked at his own crotch, and solemnly pulled down his eyelid.</text><score>5</score><joke>

<joke><type>4</type><class>2</class><text>Recently the director of a local municipal zoo, having acquired a rare Indonesian ape named Oscar, was quite displeased to find that the large aggressive animal had broken free from his cage and was roaming throughout the city. The matter was serious because the members of the staff of the zoo, while expert at caring for animals, had had no experience in capturing them. The zoo director appealed to the office of the mayor for help, and the secretary to the mayor asked, “Have you looked in the Yellow Pages?” The director said he hadn’t, but would, immediately. To his surprise, under “Animal Capturing Service” he found a listing for the A-l Ape Apprehenders. He called them and within twenty minutes a truck arrived at the administration office of the zoo. A small man emerged and rushed to the director, who was waiting at the door. “Is there a wooded area in the vicinity?” the little man asked. The director said there was, about a half mile away. “Hop in the truck,” the little man said.The director did and they drove off. Minutes later they arrived at a small grove and immediately spotted Oscar in a tree on a branch about twenty-five feet above the ground.The two men got out, went to the back of the truck, and the little man opened the door. An excited little dog jumped out and began running around in circles. The little man reached into the truck and took out a suitcase, which he opened. In the suitcase were a pair of handcuffs, which he handed to the zoo director, a sawed-off shotgun, which he leaned against the trunk of the tree, and a baseball bat. “Now,” the little man said, “I’m going up into the tree with the baseball bat, and I’m going to knock the ape out of the tree. The instant the ape hits the ground, the dog will grab the ape by the crotch. The ape, instantly and instinctively, will grab at his crotch with both hands. You snap the handcuffs on and we’ve got him.” The zoo director, pointing to the shotgun leaning against the tree, said, “I’m not too sure about this. What’s the gun for?” The little man said, “Look, I’m an expert. I know what I’m doing and things will go just fine. After all, I have the baseball bat. I know my job and it’ll never happen, but if the ape should, by any chance, knock me out of the tree, shoot the dog!”</text><score>4</score></joke>

At half time the score is 33 to 0, and it’s only with considerable effort that the little animals manage to stop the opposition’s kickoff return on the twenty-two yard line. On the first down, the big animals send the hippopotamus around the right end, but as soon as he gets to the line of scrimmage—Bang!—he’s stopped cold. Back in the huddle, the squirrel, the captain of the little animals, says, “Say, that was great! Who stopped the hippo, anyway?” “Me,” says the centipede. On the second down, the rhino charges around the left end, but he, too, is stopped cold at the line of scrimmage. ‘Terrific,” cheers the squirrel. “Who did it this time?”“Me,” says the centipede. On the third down the big animals send the elephant right up the middle, but he doesn’t get one yard before he’s knocked flat on his back. “Was that you again?” asks the squirrel of the bug. “Yup,” says the centipede modestly. “Well, where the hell were you during the first half?” demands the squirrel. “Taping my ankles.”</text><score>5</score></joke>

This happened to be Perkins, a private in Daly’s platoon. “Tell me, soldier,” began Meade, “if you got up every day at five A.M ., worked your ass off for eighteen hours, went home, prepared your gear for the next day, and fell into bed, would making love be a pleasure or hard work?” Perkins scratched his head. “I’d have to say it would be a pleasure, sir,” he finally replied. “And why is that?” “Because if it were work, Sergeant Daly would have me doing it already.”</text><score>2</score></joke>
