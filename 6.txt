Then they send him away to military school and, to their dismay, there, too, he’s considered incorrigible.

<joke><type>4</type><class>1</class><text>Two clerics get into a car accident and it’s a bad one. Both cars are totally demolished, but, amazingly, neither of the men are hurt. After they crawl out of their cars, one says to the other, “There’s nothing left, but we are unhurt. This must be a sign from God. God must have meant that we should meet and be friends and live together in peace the rest of our days.” The other replies, “I agree with you completely. This must be a sign from God.” “And look at this,” says the other. “Here’s another miracle. My car is completely demolished but this bottle of wine didn’t break. Surely God wants us to drink this wine and celebrate our good fortune.” He then hands the bottle to the other man, who takes a few big swigs and hands the bottle back. The man takes back the bottle and immediately puts the cap on. The other man asks, “Aren’t you going to take a drink?” “No, I think I’ll wait for the police to join us,” the man said.</text><score>3</score></joke>

<joke><type>4</type><class>2</class><text>The biggest myth, as measured by square footage, is that as you grow older, you gradually lose your interest in sex. This myth probably got started because younger people seem towant to have sex with each other at every available opportunity, including traffic lights, whereas older people are more likely to reserve their sexual activities for special occasions, such as the installation of a new pope.But does this mean that, as an aging person, you’re no longer capable of feeling the lust that you felt as an eighteen-year-old? Not at all! You’re attracted just as strongly as you ever were toward eighteen-year-olds! The problem is that everybody your own age seems repulsive.</text><score>3</score></joke>

He had this great new girlfriend named Wendy, he explained, and while their sex life was dynamite, he was sure it would be even better if he had her name tattooed on his prick. The tattoo artist did her best to dissuade him, pointing out that it would be very painful, and that most of the time the tattoo would just read “Wy” anyway. But Gary was undeterred, and went ahead with the tattoo. Sure enough, Wendy was crazy about the tattoo, and their sex grew even wilder and more frequent. Gary was a happy man. One day he was downtown and had to take a leak in a public men’s room. At the next urinal was a big, tall guy, and when Gary looked over he was surprised to see “Wy” on this guy’s penis as well. “How about that!” he exclaimed. “Say, is your girlfriend’s name Wendy, too?” “Dream on,” answered the guy. “Mine says, ‘Welcome to my place and Have a Nice Day.’”</text><score>4</score></joke>

As he bent over to take his ball out of the cup, a genie popped out. “This club is so exclusive that my magical services are available to anyone who hits a hole-in-one on this hole,” the genie explained. “Any wish you desire shall be granted.” “How about that!” Jack was thrilled, and immediately requested a longer penis. “Your wish is granted,” intoned the genie solemnly, and disappeared down the hole in a puff of incense. The golfer went on down the green, and as he walked, he could feel his dick slowly lengthening. As the game progressed, Jack could feel it growing and growing, down his thigh, out from his shorts, down past his knee. “Maybe this wasn’t such a great plan after all,” muttered Jack to himself, and headed back to the eighth hole with a bucket of balls. Finally he managed a hole-in-one, and when he went to collect the ball, he had to hold up the head of his penis to keep it from dragging on the ground. Out popped the genie. “This club is so exclusive that my magical services are available to anyone who hits a hole-in-one on this hole.

Everything was a contest, and the husband sank into a deep depression because he had yet towin a single one. Finally, he sought professional counsel, explaining to the shrink that while he wouldn’t mind losing once in a while, his unbroken string of defeats had him pretty down. “Simple enough. All we have to do is devise a game that you can’t possibly lose.” The
shrink thought for a moment, then proposed a pissing contest. “Whoever can pee higher on the wall wins—and how could any woman win?” Running home, the husband called up, “Darling, I’ve got a new game!” “Oooh, I love games,” she squealed, running down the stairs. “What is it?” “C’mon out here,” he instructed, pulling her around to the patio. “We’re going to stand here, piss on this wall, and whoever makes the highest mark wins.” “What fun! I’ll go first.” The woman proceeded to lift her dress, then her leg, and pee on the wall about six inches up from the ground. She turned to him expectantly. “Okay, now it’s my turn,” said the beleaguered husband eagerly. He unzipped his fly, pulled out his penis, and was just about to pee when his wife interrupted. “Hang on a sec,” she called out. “No hands allowed!”</text><score>4</score></joke>
