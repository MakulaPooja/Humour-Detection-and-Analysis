There were these two old friends who’d been playing together since they were kids, every Saturday morning and Sunday afternoon. Lester was eighty-two and his friend Ralph was eighty-one. One day, on the eighth tee, Lester suddenly gave up. He turned to his pal and said, “Ralphie, old boy, I’m afraid I’m gonna have to quit. I just can’t see anymore. I hit the ball, but I don’t know where it goes.” Ralph said to him, “You can’t quit. We’ve been playing together all these years. It wouldn’t be the same without you.” “But what can I do?” asked Lester. “You just leave it up to me. You go ahead and hit, and I’ll keep my eye on it,” said Ralph. So Lester teed up and let fly. They stood silently for a few seconds. Then Lester said, “Well, Ralph, that sounded pretty good. Did you see where it went?” “Of course I did!” said Ralph. Lester said, “Well, where did it go?” Ralph thought for a few seconds and said, “I forgot.”</text><score>4</score></joke>

<joke><type>4</type><class>2</class><text>Mort knew he was probably oversensitive about the problem, but the fact was that his eyes bulged. He went to doctor after doctor, but none seemed to know of any treatment. In desperation he looked up “Eye, Bulging” in the Yellow Pages. Sure enough a doctor was listed, and a few days later Mort found himself sitting on a vinyl couch in a seedy waiting room. A little nervous about being the only patient, he reminded himself how rare the condition was and that the doctor was a specialist. At long last he was admitted to the doctor’s office and was examined. The doctor leaned back and informed him that there was a remedy, but not an easy one. “I must cut your balls off,” he said. Mort’s eyes bulged even more as he headed for the door. But after a few weeks of thinking it over, Mort acknowledged that his bulging eyes were what kept him from getting laid in the first place, so he decided to go ahead with the operation. So he returned for the operation, and sure enough, his eyeballs sunk back into their sockets most agreeably. In fact, he looked not only normal but actually rather handsome.Delighted, he thanked the doctor profusely, and decided to treat himself to a new suit. “Charcoal gray pinstripe,” he instructed the tailor. “Medium lapel, no cuffs.” “Fine,” said the tailor, nodding. “Come back on Tuesday.” “Aren’t you going to measure me?” asked Mort. “Nah. I’ve been at this over thirty years; I can tell your size just by looking,” the tailor assured him. “That’s impossible,” blurted Mort. “Size forty-two jacket, right?” “Yes,” admitted Mort, amazed. “Thirty-two-inch inseam, right?” Mort nodded, dumbstruck. “Thirty-six-inch waist?” Again Mort nodded. “And you wear size forty underwear, right?” concluded the tailor with a smile. “Nope!” Mort told him. “Thirty-four.” “Listen, you can’t fool me,” said the tailor wearily. “Don’t even try to put one over.” “I’m telling you, I wear size thirty-four underwear,” Mort insisted. “You can’t wear size thirty-four underwear,” protested the exasperated tailor. “Your eyes would bulge out of their sockets!”</text><score>4</score></joke>

Marcia leaned over her fence and winked at her two friends. “When I wake up in the morning, I look over at Buddy,” she explained. “If his penis is hanging over his right leg, I know it’s going to be fair weather and I come right out with my laundry. On the other hand, if it’s hanging left, for sure it’s going to rain, so I hang it up inside.” “Well, smarty-pants,” said Edith, “what’s the forecast if Buddy’s got a hard-on?” “Honey,” replied Marcia with a smile, “on a day like that you don’t do the laundry.”</text><score>3</score></joke>

Chipping it off with an ice pick, he tossed it into the fire, and after several minutes a noise came forth like someone passing gas.

The second man is so amazed, he looks at the mermaid and says, “Triple my IQ.” The mermaid says, “Done,” and the second man starts to recite solutions to mathematical problems that have been stumping all of the scientists in various fields from physics to chemistry. The third man is so enthralled with the changes in his friends, he says to the mermaid: “Quintuple my IQ.” The mermaid looks at him and says, “You know, I normally don’t try to change people’s minds when they make a wish, but I really wish you’d reconsider.” Theman responds, “Nope, I want you to increase my IQ times five, and if you don’t do it, I won’t set you free.” “Please,” said the mermaid. “You don’t know what you’re asking, it’ll change your entire view on the universe. Won’t you ask for something else, a million dollars, anything?” But no matter what the mermaid said, the third man insisted on having his IQ increased by five times its usual power. So the mermaid finally relented and said, “Done.” The third man became a woman.</text><score>3</score></joke>
