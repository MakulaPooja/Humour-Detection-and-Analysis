He goes over to the man and asks about it. The man says, “For a beer I’ll tell you all about this very special pig.” The bartender figures it’s got to be a good story, and so he gives the man a beer. The man begins, “Let me tell you about this pig. He is one special pig. One night, about a year ago, my house caught fire. This pig broke out of his pen, came into the house, dragged my two littlest children out of the house, woke me and my wife, and then guided us out of the house. This pig saved my life and my family’s lives.” The bartender, impressed but still wondering about the leg, says, “Well, that’s great. But why does he have a wooden leg?”</text><score>3</score></joke>

When he enters his house, he doesn’t want to wake anyone, so he takes off his shoes and starts tiptoeing up the stairs. Halfway up the stairs, he falls over backwards and lands flat on his rear end. That wouldn’t have been so bad, except that he had a couple of empty pint bottles in his back pockets, and they broke, and the broken glass carved up his buttocks terribly. But he was so drunk, he didn’t know he was hurt. A few minutes later, as he was undressing, he notices blood, so he checks himself out in the mirror, and, sure enough, his behind is cut up something terrible. Well, he repaired the damage as best he could under the circumstances, and he went to bed. The next morning, his head was hurting, and his rear was hurting, and he was hunkering under the covers, trying to think up some good story, when his wife came into the bedroom. “Well, you really tied one on last night,” she said. “Where’d you go?” “I worked late,” he said, “and I stopped off for a couple of beers.” “A couple of beers? That’s a laugh,” she replied. “You got plastered last night. Where the heck did you go?” “What makes you so sure I got drunk last night, anyway?” “Well,” she replied, “my first big clue was when I got up this morning and found a bunch of Band-Aids stuck to the mirror.”</text><score>3</score></joke>

The doctor’s second attempt to explain the ritual of the wedding night left the groom-to-be smiling and nodding, but clearly baffled. So the good doctor gave it one more try, to no avail. Thoroughly frustrated, the doctor instructed the young woman to undress and lie down upon the examination table. She obeyed happily enough, and Dr. Jones, a humanitarian through and through, proceeded to demonstrate for the young man. For forty minutes he demonstrated. Finally, sweaty and exhausted, he hauled himself up on his elbows, turned to the fiancé, and said, “Now do you understand what I’ve been trying to tell you?” At last a glimmer of comprehension came into the young man’s blue eyes. “I’ve got it now, Doc,” he cried happily. “Good, good,” said the doctor in relief, getting down from the table and pulling up hispants. “Do you have any further questions?” “Just one,” admitted the young man. “Yes?” asked the doctor testily. “All I need to know, Dr. Jones, is how often do I have to bring her in?”</text><score>4</score></joke>

<joke><type>4</type><class>3</class><text>Old Mrs. Watkins awoke one spring morning to find that the river had flooded not only her basement but the entire first floor of her house. And, looking out her bedroom window, she saw that the water was still rising. Two men passing by in a rowboat shouted up an invitation to row to safety with them. “No, thank you,” replied Mrs. Watkins tartly. “The Lord will provide.” The men shrugged and rowed on. By evening the water level forced Mrs. Watkins to climb out on her roof, where she was spotted by a cheerful man in a motor-boat. “Don’t worry, lady,” he called across the water. “I’ll pick you right up.” “Please don’t trouble yourself—the Lord will provide.” Mrs. Watkins then turned her back on her would-be rescuer, who buzzed off downriver. Pretty soon Mrs. Watkins was forced to take refuge atop her chimney, the only part of the house still above water. Fortunately, a Red Cross cutter came by on patrol. “Jump in, ma’am,” urged a rescue worker. Mrs. Watkins shook her head vehemently. “The Lord will provide.” So the boat departed, the water rose, and the old woman drowned. Dripping wet and thoroughly annoyed, she came through the pearly gates and demanded to speak to God. “What happened?” she cried. “I thought the Lord would provide.” “For cryin’ out loud, lady,” said God wearily, “I sent three boats.”</text><score>2</score></joke>

Among the unfortunate one Friday night, were Cecily Sussman, on crutches due to a congenital spinal malformation, and Irving Bland, who had suffered from a terrible lisp all his life. “Cecily and Irving,” asked Wanda, “do you wish to be healed?” “Yeth, ma’am,” said Irving, and Cecily nodded vigorously. Wanda motioned them behind a purple velvet curtain and proceeded to chant and pray, grinding powders together and swaying before the audience. Finally she intoned, “Cecily, throw out your left crutch.” A crutch came sailing over the curtain. “Cecily, throw out your right crutch.” A second crutch clattered on the floor at the healer’s feet. “Now, Irving,” asked Wanda solemnly, “say something to the people.” Irving’s voice came clearly from behind the purple curtain. “Thethily Thuthman just fell on her ath.”</text><score>2</score></joke>

He came home that night with a heavy heart and explained their newly straitened circumstances to his wife. “Since we need to start somewhere, Myrna,” he went on, “you better learn to cook so we can let the kitchen staff go.” His wife thought it over for a few moments. Nodding, she suggested, “Okay, George, but you better learn to screw so we can fire the chauffeur.”</text><score>2</score></joke>

<joke><type>4</type><class>3</class><text>Before going to Europe on business, a man drove his Rolls-Royce to a downtown New York City bank and went in to ask for an immediate loan of $5,000. The loan officer, taken aback, requested collateral and so the man said, “Well then, here are the keys to my Rolls-Royce.” The loan officer promptly had the car driven into the bank’s underground parking for safe keeping, and gave him $5,000. Two weeks later, the man walked through the bank’s doors and asked to settle up his loan and get his car back. “That will be five thousand dollars in principal, and fifteen dollars and forty cents in interest,” the loan officer said. The man wrote out a check and started to walk away. “Wait, sir,” the loan officer said. “While you were gone, I found out you are a millionaire. Why in the world would you need to borrow five thousand dollars?” The man smiled. “Where else could I park my Rolls-Royce in Manhattan for two weeks and pay only fifteen dollars and forty cents?”</text><score>3</score></joke>
