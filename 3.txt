One day he showed up for his visit in an unusually good mood. “Have I got the girl for your Seymour,” he announced, leaning over conspiratorially. “Nothing less than a princess, Princess Margaret Rose!” Ignoring the fact that Mrs. Schwartz had turned pale, the matchmaker went on. “She’s a lovely girl. You know she has her own palace right on the Côte d’Azur, plus a chalet for the winter season in Gstaad, and of course, there’s the penthouse inManhattan if you should get lonely for your son—” “But wait, she’s a shiksa,” interrupted Mrs. Schwartz. “That’s totally unacceptable.” “Let me tell you a little about the palace. Sixty-five rooms, not counting the servants’ quarters or the stables, and maybe you’d like to ice skate or take a dip in a nice indoor Olympic- sized pool? Rembrandts and Caravaggios everywhere, and on the grounds—”“Moishe, listen to me,” broke in Mrs. Schwartz. “A gentile girl, I don’t care who she is, is absolutely out of the question.” “And maybe your Seymour likes a nice car?” The matchmaker went on, unperturbed. “In the garage is a Rolls Royce, a Ferrari, a Maserati, and the two Mercedes used for errands around town. And, of course, there’s a couple of chauffeurs in case Seymour should get tired of driving . . .” The ongoing inventory of Princess Margaret Rose’s attractions, physical and material, failed to remove the frown from Mrs. Schwartz’s face. Finally, the matchmaker said, “Listen, let’s give the boy a chance to hear all this for himself.” Reluctantly, Mrs. Schwartz agreed. To Seymour, sitting on the couch next to his mother, the matchmaker once again patiently catalogued the splendor of all that Princess Margaret Rose, shiksa or not, had to offer. “Ma, I gotta say, it doesn’t sound so bad,” admitted Seymour. It took another good hour or so, but finally the two men persuaded Mrs. Schwartz to go along with the arrangement, and with much handshaking and back-patting, the matchmaker was shown to the door. “Well,” he said as it closed behind him, “at least half my job is done.”</text><score>2</score></joke>
