A sucker? I’ll settle for four wishes.” “Only three,” the fish murmured weakly. Fuming, the man debated the pros and cons of accepting the three wishes or continuing to bargain for that one extra wish. Finally, the negotiator decided it wasn’t worth looking a gift fish in the mouth and said, “All right fish, you win, three wishes.” Unfortunately, the fish was dead.</text><score>2</score></joke>

Next a big, burly construction worker sauntered up and took the orange from the exhausted weight lifter. After ten minutes of intense squeezing and a lot of grimacing, the construction worker finally admitted defeat. “No other takers?” the manager asked with a satisfied sneer. “May I try?” responded a short, skinny bespectacled man from the back row.
