The store—if that is what it is—looks a little seedy and rundown, but the man behind the counter looks friendly, so in goes the American and says, “M’sieur, je veux acheter un capeau noir.” “Mais, monsieur, j’ai des capeaux rouges, des capeaux blancs, et des capeaux marrons, mais pas des capeaux noire.” After explaining that he has red, white, and brown condoms, but no black condoms, the man asks the American why he wants a black condom, “Pourquoi avez vous besoin d’un capeau noir?” “Ma femme est morte.” After the American says that his wife is dead, the man exclaims, “O, Monsieur!

After he explained his predicament to Merlin, the wizard looked thoughtful and asked the king to come back in a week. A week later King Arthur was back in Merlin’s laboratory, where the good wizard showed him his latest invention. It was a chastity belt . . . except that it had a rather large hole in the most obvious place. “This is no good, Merlin!” the king exclaimed. “Look at this opening. How is this supposed to protect m’lady, the queen?” “Ah, sire, just observe,” said Merlin as he searched his cluttered workbench until he found what he was looking for. He then selected his most worn-out wand, one that he was going to discard anyway. He inserted it into the gaping aperture of the chastity belt, whereupon a small guillotine blade came down and cut it neatly in two. “Merlin, you are a genius!” said the grateful monarch. “Now I can leave, knowing that my queen is fully protected.” After putting Guinevere in the device, King Arthur set out upon his quest. Several years passed before he returned to Camelot. Immediately, he assembled all his knights in the courtyard and had them drop their trousers for an informal “short arm” inspection. Sure enough! Each and every one of them was either amputated or damaged in some way. All of them except Sir Galahad. “Sir Galahad,” exclaimed King Arthur. “The one and only true knight! Only you among all the nobles have been true to me. What is it in my power to grant you? Name it and it is yours!” But Sir Galahad was speechless.</text><score>5</score></joke>
