<joke><type>4</type><class>2</class><text>Hungry for company, the young couple is delighted when a spaceship lands in a field on their very isolated farm and out steps a young, very humanoid Martian couple. They get to talking and soon the wife invites the Martians to dinner. During dinner the conversation is so stimulating and all four get along so well that they decide to swap partners for the night. The farmer’s wife and the male Martian get the master bedroom, and when he undresses, she sees that his phallus is very small indeed. “What are you going to do with that?” she can’t resist asking. “Watch,” he says smartly. He twists his right ear and his penis suddenly grows to eight inches in length—but it’s still as skinny as a pencil. And again the farmer’s wife can’t suppress a disparaging comment. So the Martian twists his left ear, at which his prick grows as thick as a sausage. And he and the woman proceed to screw like crazy all night long. The next morning the Martian couple take off after cordial farewells, and the farmer turns to his wife. “So how was it?” he asks curiously. “It was fabulous, really out of this world,” reports the wife with a big smile. “How about you?” “Nothing special,” admits the farmer. “Kinda weird in fact. All night long she kept playing with my ears.”</text><score>3</score></joke>

Adam looked at God and said, “Well, give me the good news first.” Smiling, God explained, “I’ve got two new organs for you. One is called a brain. It will allow you to be very intelligent, create new things, and have intelligent conversations with Eve. The other organ I have for you is called a penis. It will allow you to reproduce your now intelligent life form and populate this planet. Eve will be very happy that you now have this organ and can give her children.” Adam, very excited, exclaimed, “These are great gifts you have given to me. What could possibly be bad news after such great tidings?” God looked upon Adam and said with great sorrow, “The bad news is that when I created you, I only gave you enough blood to operate one of these organs at a time.”</text><score>5</score></joke>

One evening, they’re in a bar arguing over which of them can have sex the most times in one night. They decide to settle the issue by going to the local brothel and gathering experimental evidence. So they get to the brothel, pair off with a couple of the ladies, and go to their respective rooms. The American guy energetically balls his woman and, reaching up with a pencil, makes a “1” mark on the wall. Then he falls asleep. He wakes up in a couple of hours and screws her again, albeit a little less enthusiastically this time. Again, he reaches back andmarks a “1” on the wall. Again, he falls asleep. He wakes up again in a couple of hours and lethargically humps the hooker again. He drowsily marks another “1” on the wall. Then he falls asleep for the rest of the night. The next morning, the Latin guy barges into the other guy’s room to see how he did. He takes one look at the wall and exclaims, “A hundred and eleven?

<joke><type>3</type><class>3</class><text>Once there was a beautiful woman who loved to work in her vegetable garden, but no matter what she did, she couldn’t get her tomatoes to ripen. Admiring her neighbor’s garden, and his beautiful bright red tomatoes, she went over one day and asked him to tell her his secret.“It’s really quite simple,” the old man explained. “Twice each day, in the morning and in the evening, I expose myself in front of the tomatoes and they turn red with embarrassment.” Desperate for the perfect garden, she decided to try the same thing and proceeded to expose herself to her plants twice daily. Two weeks passed and her neighbor stopped by to check her progress. “So,” he asked, “any luck with your tomatoes?” “No,” she replied excitedly, “but you should see the size of my cucumbers!”</text><score>4</score></joke>

The instructor called them into a room and said to the first one, “Take this gun and go into the next room. I want you to assassinate whomever you find there. If you don’t do this, you don’t graduate.” The man took the gun and went into the next room, where he found his wife. Taking one look at her, he returned to the instructor, threw down his gun and quit, saying, “I can’t do this.” The next man went into the room and saw his own wife. He hesitated a moment, then he, too, resigned. The third man took the gun and went into the room. The instructor heard six rapid shots, followed by screams, thuds, crashes, then silence. Then the door opened and out came the third agent all bloody, and his shirt in shreds. He said to the instructor, “You idiot, you gave me blanks! I had to strangle her!”</text><score>5</score></joke>

This would have struck him as odd, except that he was too drunk to notice anything out of the ordinary. “Hey,” he said to the bartender, “there’s a horse standing next to me.” “I know,” replied the bartender, wiping a glass. “That horse comes in here all the time— and you know, once, just once, I’d like to see him show some kind of expression. He must be part Vulcan or something.” The bum looked at the horse’s face. A better poker player could not exist on this earth. “Uh-huh.” “Tell ya what,” the bartender suggested, “I’ll give you a free round of drinks if you can make him laugh.” The bum thought for a second or two, then said, “Sure.” He took the horse by the reins and led him into the men’s bathroom. A moment later, he and the horse came out again, and the horse was laughing uproariously. Stunned, the bartender poured the bum’s free round of drinks without taking his eyes off the animal. “That was amazing!” he told the bum as he finished off his last drink. “I’ll give you another free round of drinks if you can make him cry!” Smiling, the bum said, “All right,” and once again led the horse into the men’s room. When they came out a minute later, the horse was wallowing in tears. Shaking his head and rubbing his disbelieving eyes, the bartender poured the bum his second round of drinks. “You’ve gotta tell me,” he said as the bum finished his drink, “how on earth did you get that horse to laugh and cry?” “Well,” said the bum, clearing his throat with pride, “First I told him that my dick was longer than his, and then I proved it.”</text><score>2</score></joke>

A few hundred years after they’ve been put in place, an angel flutters down to them. A wave of his hand, and suddenly the statues come to life and the man and the woman step down from their pedestals. The angel says, “I have been sent to grant the mutual request you both have made after hundreds of years of standing across from each other, unable to move. But be quick—you only have fifteen minutes until you must become statues again.” The man looks at the woman. They both flush and giggle, and then run off into some underbrush. The sound of great rustling comes from the bushes, and seven minutes later, they come back to the angel, obviously satisfied. The angel smiles at the couple. “That was only seven minutes—why not go back and do it again?”The former statues look at each other for a minute, and then the woman says, “Why not? But let’s reverse it this time—you hold down the pigeon, and I’ll shit on it.”</text><score>2</score></joke>

<joke><type>3</type><class1</class><text>One dark night outside a small town, a fire started inside the local chemical plant. Before long it exploded into flames and an alarm went out to fire departments from miles around. After fighting the fire for over an hour, the chemical company president approached the fire chief and said, “All of our secret formulas are in the vault in the center of the plant. They must be saved! I will give fifty thousand dollars to the engine company that brings them out safely!” As soon as the chief heard this, he ordered the firemen to strengthen their attack on the blaze. After two more hours of attacking the fire, the president of the company offered $100,000 to the engine company that could bring out the company’s secret files. In the distance, a long siren was heard and another fire truck came into sight. It was a local volunteer fire company composed entirely of men over sixty-five. To everyone’s amazement, the little fire engine raced through the chemical plant gates and drove straight into the middle of the inferno. In the distance the other firemen watched as the old-timers hopped off their rig and began to fight the fire with an effort that they had never seen before. After an hour of intense fighting, the volunteer company had extinguished the fire and saved the secret formulas. Joyous, the chemical company president announced that he would double the reward to $200,000 and walked over to personally thank each of the volunteers. After thanking each of the old men individually, the president asked the group what theyintended to do with the reward money. The fire truck driver looked him right in the eye and said, “The first thing we’re going to do is fix the damn brakes on that truck!”</text><score>5</score></joke>
