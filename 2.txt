When the news had sunk in, he said, “Listen, Doc, you’ve known me a long time. Do you have any suggestions as to how I could make the most of my remaining months?” “Have you ever married?” asked the doctor. Fred explained that he’d been a bachelor all his life. “You might think about taking a wife,” the doctor proposed. “After all, you’ll need someone to look after you during the final illness.” “That’s a good point, Doc,” mused Fred. “And with only six months to live I’d better make the most of my time.” “May I make one more suggestion?” asked the doctor. When Fred nodded, he said, “Marry a Jewish girl.” “A Jewish girl—how come?” asked Fred. “It’ll seem longer.”</text><score>1</score></joke>

So he was surprised when the fellow’s wife came in a month later and he found she was pregnant again. “What happened?” he scolded. “All your husband had to do was keep the condom on—is that so difficult?” “He try, he try very hard,” stammered the poor woman, “but after three days, he have to pee so bad he cut the end off.”</text><score>5</score></joke>

As the traveler headed for the barn, the farmer shouted after him that he was putting a barricade of eggs around his daughter’s room just in case he should get any ideas. “If a single egg’s broken in the morning,” he yelled, “I’ll shoot you in the back.” The fellow bedded down comfortably enough in the hay, but all night he was tossing and turning, thinking of the farmer’s daughter. Finally, he couldn’t take it anymore. He ran inside, through the wall of eggs and into the girl’s room, where she showed him a very good time until it was almost dawn. Then, in something of a panic, he left the room and began frantically gluing all the eggs back together. The last one had just been set in place when the farmer came out of his room. “Boy have you got will power,” he commented, looking admiringly at his guest. “Not a single egg broken. Just for that, you get breakfast on the house.” Taking five eggs off the pile, the farmer took them into the kitchen and cracked the first one against the edge of a bowl. Nothing came out. He cracked the second egg and still nothing came out. And the third, fourth, and fifth. Of course, they were all empty. “Goddamn rooster’s been using a rubber again!” groaned the farmer.</text><score>3</score></joke>

He died and was welcomed into Heaven by St. Peter. “Life here is very similar to life down there,” the saint said, pointing down to earth. “You can still get hurt up here, but it’s offset by the fact that nothing is illegal and everything is free. Just be careful, and enjoy yourself.” Amazed and somewhat bewildered, the man started to take in the sights. Not watching where he was going, he stepped off the curb and was almost run over by an Oldsmobile Cutlass. “Wow, who the heck was that?” the man wondered aloud. “That was Mr. Olds,” said St. Peter. “He’s a driving maniac, but you’ve got to be careful if you’re going to stay here.” The newcomer nodded and continued on. A minute later, as he was carefully crossing over to a striptease joint, a speeding Cadillac nearly ran him over. “Goddamn it! Who the hell was that asshole?” he screamed at St. Peter, who was still keeping an eye on him. “None other than Mr. Ford. As you can see, the idiot enjoys driving fast,” replied St. Peter. “I know it’s difficult, but do try to be careful.” The man made extra sure before he attempted a third crossing, but just as he was about to reach the other side successfully, a Maserati driven by some long-haired freak appeared out of nowhere and bumped him back across the street. “Okay, who the fuck was that?” he screamed as he lay sprawled at the saint’s feet. “Keep your voice down,” St. Peter hissed. “That’s the boss’s son.”</text><score>2</score></joke>
