As Horace shows the interviewer around the grounds, she is flabbergasted. Everything is immaculate. The flowers are beautiful, the grass is perfectly manicured, and the trees are expertly pruned. And his running commentary on each shrub and bush is equally impressive. She can’t believe it. Here’s this guy in an insane asylum, and he’s probably the most talented gardener and landscape designer she’s ever met, with an inexhaustable knowledge of every aspect of gardening. At the end of the tour, she says to Horace, “I am enormously impressed with your work. Not only am I going to write a feature article about you and your work, but I’m going to petition my congressman to have you released from here, so you can get a good job on the outside. Your considerable talents shouldn’t go to waste.” She turns and walks away. “When she gets about twenty feet away from him, a huge brick flies into the back of her head and Horace yells, “You won’t forget about me, will you?”</text><score>3</score></joke>

The psychiatrist who headed the institution, with commendable caution, decided, however, to interview him first. “Tell me,” said he, “if we release you, as we are considering doing, what do you intend to do with your life?” The inmate said, “It would be wonderful to get back to real life and, if I do, I will certainly refrain from making my former mistake. I was a nuclear physicist, you know, and it was the stress of my work in weapons research that helped to put me here. If I am released, I shall confine myself to work in pure theory, where I trust the situation will be less difficult and stressful.” “Marvelous,” said the psychiatrist. “Or else,” ruminated the inmate, “I might teach. There is something to be said for spending one’s life in developing a new generation of scientists.” “Absolutely,” said the psychiatrist. “Then again, I might write. There is considerable need for books on science for the general public. Or I might even write a novel based on my experiences in this fine institution.” “An interesting possibility,” said the psychiatrist. “And finally, if none of these things appeals to me, I can always continue to be a teakettle.”</text><score>3</score></joke>

Not only was she the bride of Christ, she had taken a vow of celibacy, and besides, it would be a sin. “Good point,” admitted the hitchhiker coolly, “but if you don’t let me have sex with you, I’ll kill myself—and that’ll be a mortal sin for me. How could you have that on your conscience?” The nun thought hard, then asked, “Are you Catholic?” The hitchhiker assured her that he was. “Are you married?” “I’m as single as you are, Sister,” he promised. “All right,” she said, “then I’ll agree to having anal intercourse with you. That will only be a venial sin.” She pulled over, they went off into the woods and had sex, and then got back in the car. A few miles down the road, the hitchhiker admitted he had a confession to make. “I really enjoyed that, Sister, but I lied to you: I’m Protestant.” The nun blanched. “And that’s not all,” the hitchhiker went on unhappily. “I’ve got a wife and two kids.” The nun turned even paler, and her hands trembled on the steering wheel.

I’m not upset that you’re such a sly one, I’m upset over the missed opportunities. A million times I could have said, “Some of my best friend is Jewish.” Seated next to an aged rabbi on a transcontinental flight, the eager young priest couldn’t resist the opportunity to proselytize. “You really should think about coming over to the Roman Catholic faith, being welcomed into the arms of the Holy Father,” he enthused. “It is the only true faith, you know—only those who believe in the Sacraments shall be admitted to the Kingdom of Heaven when they die.” The rabbi nodded indulgently, but expressed no interest in the mechanics of conversion, and eventually the young priest fell silent, depressed by his failure. A little while later, the plane ran into a tremendous hurricane, lost power, and crashed into the Illinois countryside. Miraculously the priest was thrown, unhurt, from his seat. When he came to and looked back at the flamingwreckage, the first thing he saw was the rabbi, making the sign of the cross. Crossing himself and whispering a brief prayer of gratitude, the priest ran over and took his arm. “Praise the Lord!” he babbled joyfully. “You did hear the Word after all, didn’t you? And just in time for it to comfort you through mortal peril. And you do wish to be saved, to become one of us now. Alleluia!” “Vat on earth are you talking about?” asked the elderly fellow, still rather dazed. “Sir, I saw it with my own eyes.

One day he couldn’t help remarking that the church was in perfect repair, while the synagogue needed a new roof and was generally dilapidated. “I don’t seem to be able to get a penny out of my congregation,” confessed the rabbi, “wealthy though they are. And while your parishioners are mostly blue-collar workers, you’re obviously rolling in money.” “I’ll show you how I do it,” offered the priest generously, and beckoned for the rabbi to follow him into the confession booth. Soon a penitent entered. “Father, I have sinned,” she murmured. “I have committed adultery.” “Three Hail Marys and ten dollars in the collection box,” ordered the priest. And so it went; for each of his sinning parishioners, the priest prescribed some Hail Marys and a donation. Eventually the priest turned to the rabbi and suggested that he handle the next one. “Professional courtesy,” he said with a smile. “I’m sure you’ve gotten the point.” So the rabbi was behind the screen when the next person came into the booth. “Father, I committed adultery three times last week,” she confessed in a whisper. “Thirty dollars and nine Hail Marys,” ordered the rabbi. “But, Father, I only have twenty-five dollars,” she admitted in great distress. “That’s all right,” the rabbi consoled her, not missing a beat. “Put the twenty-five in the collection box and go home and do it again. We’ve got a special this week—four for the price of two and a half.”</text><score>2</score></joke>

I dropped to my knees and prayed to God to save us—and then for a thousand feet all around us, the wind calmed and the rain stopped. We made it to the airport, and since then my faith has never wavered.” The Moslem then told of a terrifying incident on his pilgrimage to Mecca. “A tremendous sandstorm came up out of nowhere, and within minutes my camel and I were almost buried. Sure I was going to die, I prostrated myself toward Mecca and prayed to Allah to deliver me. And suddenly, for a thousand feet all around me, the swirling dust settled and I was able to make myway safely across the desert. Since then I have been the devoutest of believers.” Nodding respectfully, the Jew then told his tale. “One Sabbath I was walking back from the temple when I saw a huge sack of money just lying there at the edge of the road. It had clearly been abandoned, and I felt it was mine to take home, but obviously this would have been a violation of the Sabbath. So I dropped to my knees and prayed to Yahweh—and suddenly, for a thousand feet all around me, it was Tuesday.”</text><score>3</score></joke>

Why didn’t you say so?” Hersch’s voice was filled with reproach. “Well, you’re in luck again. Just over that sand dune’s a lovely resort, I used to vacation there myself. They’ll have all the water you can drink.” And Hersch got back in his car and droveaway. The Arab managed to stagger to the top of the sand dune, and, sure enough, a neon-lit sign announcing Le Club Gaza was visible from the top. The Arab summoned the last of his strength, crawled across the burning sand to the entrance, and collapsed. “Water, effendi, water,” he croaked. “Ah, you want water,” said the doorman sympathetically. “We have all kinds: mineral water, well water, club soda, Perrier, seltzer. Only thing is, you have to have a tie to get in.”</text><score>3</score></joke>

Well, one Sunday we hit a big bump and all the eggs flew out of the basket and onto the road.” The teacher asks for the moral of the story and Amy replies, “Don’t keep all your eggs in one basket.” Next, little Sandy offers to tell her story, and she says, “Well, my dad owns a farm, too, and every weekend we take the chicken eggs and put them in the incubator. Last weekend only eight of the twelve eggs hatched.” The teacher asks for the moral of the story and Sandy replies, “Don’t count your eggs before they’re hatched.” Finally it’s little Andy’s turn and he says, “My uncle John fought in the war, and his plane was shot down over enemy territory. He jumped out before it crashed with only a machine gun, a machete, and case of beer. On the way down he drank the case of beer. “Unfortunately, he landed right in the middle of one hundred enemy soldiers. He shot seventy with his machine gun, but ran out of bullets, so he pulled out his machete and killed twenty more. The blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands.” The teacher looks in shock at Andy and asks if there is possibly any moral to his story and Andy replies, “Don’t mess with uncle John after he’s been drinking.”</text><score>3</score></joke>

After browsing through the dildos for something special, he decided to consult the old guy behind the counter. The old man said, “We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don’t know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except. . . .” and he stopped. “Except what?” the man asked. “Nothing, nothing.” “C’mon, tell me! I need something!” “Well, sir, I don’t usually mention this, but there is the ‘voodoo dick.’” The old man reached under the counter, pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols, and opened it. There lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and commented that it looked like every other dildo in this shop. “But you haven’t seen what it’ll do,” said the proprietor. He pointed to a door and said, “Voodoo dick, the door.” The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook, then started to split down the middle, at which point the old man commanded, “Voodoo dick, back in your box!” The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, quiescent once more. “I’ll take it!” said the businessman. The old man said it wasn’t for sale, but finally surrendered it for seven hundred dollars in cash. Pleased as punch, the businessman gave his wife the gift, explained that all she had to do was say “Voodoo dick, my pussy” if she got lonely, and set off on his business trip. After a few days, the wife grew unbearably horny. Feeling a little foolish, she opened the box and said tentatively, “Voodoo dick, my pussy!” The voodoo dick shot out of the box, made a beeline for her crotch, and started pumping away. It was fabulous, like nothing she’d ever experienced before, and she lay back and enjoyed the rush of pleasure. After three orgasms, she decided she’d had enough and reached to pull out the dildo. It wouldn’t budge. Nothing worked. The voodoo dick was stuck, thrusting away. Her husband had forgotten to tell her how to shut it off. Desperate, she pulled on a skirt, got in the car, and headed for the hospital, nearly fainting with excitement and exhaustion. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and to her horror, a squad car pulled her over. First the policeman asked for her license. Then, observing her disheveled state, he asked how much she’d had to drink. Twitching and sweating, she gasped, “I haven’t been drinking, officer. A voodoo dick is stuck in my pussy, and it won’t stop screwing!” “Sure, lady,” said the officer after another long look at her. “Voodoo dick, my ass!”</text><score>4</score></joke>

After reaching the gates to heaven, the man was talking with St. Peter and he asked, “I know I was good during my life, and I really appreciate being brought to heaven, but I’m really curious—what does hell look like?” So St. Peter thought about it a moment and finally said, “I’ll tell you what, I’ll let you see what hell looks like before you are officially entered into heaven. Come with me.” And so St. Peter lead the man to an elevator and said, “Take this elevator to the very bottom floor. When the door opens, you will see what hell looks like, but whatever you do, do not get out of the elevator.” “Thank you,” replied the man, who climbed into the elevator and hit the button for the lowest floor. After nearly an hour waiting in the elevator, the doors opened and the man peered out. Before him was a lifeless frozen wasteland. All the man could see were huge mountains of ice through blankets of snow. Remembering what St. Peter said, the man quickly pushed the button for the top floor, the doors closed and he traveled back up to heaven. After returning to heaven, the man approached St. Peter and said, “I’m ready to enter into heaven now, but before I do, I have just one more question.” “Go ahead,” replied St. Peter, and so the man asked, “I thought hell would be fire and brimstone, but instead all I saw was snow and ice. Is that what it’s really like?” St. Peter thought about this for a second and finally answered, “Snow and ice, huh? I guess the Buffalo Bills finally won a Super Bowl.”</text><score>4</score></joke>

Both balls landed about twenty feet from the edge of a little pond that stood between them and the hole. Moses took out a five-wood and landed his ball in excellent position. Jesus took out a five-iron. “Hang on, hang on,” cautioned Moses. “Use a wood—you’ll never make it.” “If Arnold Palmer can make that shot with a five-iron, so can I,” said Jesus. His ball landed in the middle of the lake. Moses parted the waters, retrieved the ball, and sighed when he saw Jesus still holding the five-iron. “If Arnold Palmer can make that shot with a five-iron, so can I,” maintained Jesus. Again Moses had to part the waters to retrieve the ball. By this time there were a number of people waiting to play through, and Moses said firmly, “Listen, Jesus, I’m not fetching the ball another time. Use a wood.” Jesus, however, still insisted, “If Arnold Palmer can make that shot with a five-iron, so can I.” Splash! Moses shook his head. “I told you, I’m not budging. Get it yourself.” So Jesus walked off across the water toward where the ball had landed. At this, the onlookers gaped in astonishment. One came over to Moses and stammered, “I can’t believe my eyes—that guy must think he’s Jesus Christ!” In response, Moses shook his head gloomily. “He is Jesus Christ.

Many years later, the widower was playing with a friend when he hit the exact same slice.
